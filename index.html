   <h2>About This Page</h2>
   <p>This page is intended to be a navigtion page serving myself and maybe some other users,with custom links and background,perhaps a search engine as well.</p>
   <p>I wanted to buy the domain:"www.stsecurity.com",but the price is too high so I will just let this page stay like this for the time being.</p>
   <p>If you are interested in what kind of person I am or have questions to ask,you can simply email me.</p>
