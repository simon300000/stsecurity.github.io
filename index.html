  <h1>Welcome!</h1>
  <p>I am still a beginner of HTML5,so as you can see this page is unfinished.</p>
  <p>However,I do hope you,whoever you are,could send me an email,letting me know that my first web page has it's first visitor,I will be more than happy if you do so.</p>
  <p>I really appreciate it that you have read this far.And here is my e-mail address:st.stec@gmail.com</p>
  <p>Thanks again.</p>
  <h2>About This Page</h2>
  <p>This page is intended to be a navigtion page serving myself and maybe some other users,with custom links and background,perhaps a search engine as well.</p>
  <p>I wanted to buy the domain:"www.stsecurity.com",but the price is too high so I will just let this page stay like this for the time being.</p>
  <p>If you are interested in what kind of person I am or have questions to ask,you can simply email me.</p>
